    }
}

// Register route controller class or classes
$router = new Router;
$router->registerRoutes(BasicController::class);

// Handle the request by method / request URI
$test = $router->handleRequest('GET', '/photos/42/edit');

// Expose the class & target endpoint
$class = new $test['class'];
$endpoint = $test['endpoint'];

// Call the endpoint with arguments
$class->$endpoint(...array_values($test['parameters']));

// Prints:
// edit: 42
